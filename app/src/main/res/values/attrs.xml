                 IMEs may not be able to do this, especially when running on a small
                 screen where there is little space.  In that case it does not need to

                 of the application be shown behind.  Though there will likely be limited
                 access to the application available from the user, it can make the
                 experience of a (mostly) fullscreen IME less jarring.  Note that when
                 this flag is specified the IME may <em>not</em> be set up to be able
                 to display text, so it should only be used in situations where this is
                 not needed.

                 Note that by setting this flag, there can be cases where the action
                 is simply never available to the user.  Setting this generally means
                 that you think showing text being edited is more important than the

                 this indicates that the action should not be available in-line as

                 because the action has such a significant impact or is not recoverable
                 enough that accidentally hitting it should be avoided, such as sending
                 a message.    Note that {@link android.widget.TextView} will
                 automatically set this flag for you on multi-line text views.

                 used for, typically, account ID or password input.  It is expected that IMEs
                 normally are able to input ASCII even without being told so (such IMEs
                 already respect this flag in a sense), but there could be some cases they
                 aren't when, for instance, only non-ASCII input languages like Arabic,
                 Greek, Hebrew, Russian are enabled in the IME.  Applications need to be
                 aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and not all IMEs will respect it.
                 However, it is strongly recommended for IME authors to respect this flag
